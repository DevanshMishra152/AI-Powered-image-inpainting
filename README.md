# AI-Powered-image-inpainting
This project implements an AI-driven Image Inpainting pipeline capable of intelligently reconstructing missing, damaged, or unwanted regions in images. By combining Segmentation, Mask Generation, and Diffusion-based Image Inpainting, the system fills masked areas with visually coherent content that blends seamlessly with the original image.
